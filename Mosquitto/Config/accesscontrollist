#1) Define Needs
#Lets use my home automation system as an example.  I’ll limit to just a few clients in this example.  I have my automation server (home assistant), a WiFi light (a sonoff) and a light sensor.  Lets state the minimum needs of each client:

#Home Assistant
#Process all MQTT messages to allow full control of devices and to run automation scripts
#WiFi light (sonoff)
#Subscribes to “cmnd/light/POWER” for control
#Subscribes to “cmnd/light/UPDATE” for OTA updates
#Publishes to “stat/light/POWER” for status and confirmation
#Light Sensor
#Subscribes to “cmnd/sensor/kitchen/light” for a manual sensor reading
#Subscribes to “cmnd/sensor/kitchen/light/set” to change settings
#Subscribes to “cmnd/sensor/UPDATE” for OTA updates
#Publishes to “stat/sensor/kitchen/level” with current light level
#2) Create User Accounts
#We can now see we have three clients with distinct, separate needs.  This is a good case where three MQTT user accounts would be beneficial.  Let’s say our Light Sensor has a security flaw that accidentally exposes the password, we don’t want to give someone full access to our system!

#If you haven’t already, follow Digital Ocean’s tutorial on setting up and securing Mosquitto.  To add a new user account is quite easy.  Simply run the following command and follow the prompts to enter a password.

#sudo mosquitto_passwd /etc/mosquitto/passwd <new-user>
#So in total, you should run 3 commands that look something like these, note how I like to obscure the usernames a little.  Call me paranoid, but it makes them just a little bit harder to guess.

#sudo mosquitto_passwd /etc/mosquitto/passwd homeassist
#sudo mosquitto_passwd /etc/mosquitto/passwd sonoffswitch
#sudo mosquitto_passwd /etc/mosquitto/passwd lightsense
#Note: make sure you use a very secure password for the home assitant account as it will have full access!
#3) Tell Mosquitto to use ACLs
#Open your mosquitto configuration file:

#sudo vim /etc/mosquitto/conf.d/default.conf
#Add the following line, specifying where you put your ACL file.  (I put mine in the same directory as the passwd file)

#acl_file /etc/mosquitto/acl
#MQTT has two types of wildcards:
#“#” means literally everything and is “recursive” so can only be used on the end of a topic.
#example “cmnd/light/#” will receive every message from topics that start with “cmnd/light“.
#“+” meanse literally everything but only one level, so one or more may be used inside a topic.
#example “stat/+/POWER” could receive the “POWER” message from every device.
#Generate your ACLs
#Open your ACL file and add your topics and user accounts to it like below.  Note the three types of permissions; there are read, write and readwrite.  Wild cards may also be used. Also, please for the sanity of future you document what each one does!

# Give Home Assitant full access to everything
#user homeassist
#topic readwrite #

# Allow the sonoffs to read/write to cmnd/# and stat/#
#user sonoffswitch
#topic readwrite cmnd/#
#topic readwrite stat/#

# Allows the light sensor to read/write to the sensor topics
#user lightsense
#topic cmnd/sensor/#
#topic stat/sensor/#
#Notice how the light sensors have a similar permission level as the sonoffs?  The sensors don’t need to read/write to the sonoffs so they shouldn’t be allowed.  However, we may want the sonoffs to be able to directly read the sensors.

#4) Save and profit ??
#Save all the settings and make sure they’re right.  Normally I wouldn’t reccomend it, but it may be useful to right down the usernames and passwords of all the accounts.  This could save a lot of confusion with all the different accounts.  (of course you should destroy the passwords after)

#Be sure to restart both home assitant if you’ve got it running and the Mosquitto server so that the changes can be applied.

#sudo service mosquitto restart
#sudo service homeassistant restart
 

#Let me know how you go or if you run into trouble in the comments below.  I couldn’t find much documentation on actually implementing ACLs and multiple user accounts so hopefully this makes it easier for others.
